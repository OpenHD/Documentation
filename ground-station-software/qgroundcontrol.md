# QGroundControl

To establish a connection between OpenHD and QGroundControl over Wi-Fi or Ethernet, follow these steps:

1. The Wifi hostpot is by default ON when disarm and OFF when arm because the possible interference, you can change it using the sidebar, if you want to use Ethernet just connect the ethernet cable
 > :warning: **Important Note:** HereÂ´s what can happen if you use wifi as a connection method for external telemetry during flight.

2. Next power on your Air- and GroundPi
3. Enter in the Ground tab and here change the settings "Ethernet" from disable to Hostpot or forward+internet, the last one is very handy to give internet to the pc from your phone

2. Fill in the following parameters:
   - **Name:** Enter a name for the connection, e.g., "TCP OpenHD".
   - **Automatically Connect on Start:** Check this option.
   - **Type:** Select "TCP".
   - **Server Address:** Input "192.168.3.1".
   - **Port:** Set the port to "5760".
   - Click "OK" to confirm.

3. Click on "Connect" and wait for telemetry data to be received, which typically takes around 5 seconds, **don't go on with the next step until you are connected.**

4. At this point, telemetry data should be available, but video may not be. Follow these steps to resolve this:

By following these steps, telemetry data and video feed should now be accessible within QGroundControl. Enabling the "Automatically Connect on Start" option eliminates the need to reconnect during subsequent program launches.
