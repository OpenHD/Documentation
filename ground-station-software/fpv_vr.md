# FPV\_VR

## Displaying the video stream via _**FPV\_VR**_

Connect your device either via USB Tethering, Wifi-Hotspot or Ethernet-Hotspot to the GroundPi. USB tethering is more reliable and preferred.

### Android

[FPV\_VR app in Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=constantin.fpv_vr.wifibroadcast) [Usage information and source code](https://github.com/Consti10/FPV_VR_OS) Leave `FORWARD_STREAM=rtp` in openhd-settings-1.txt to send a rtp h264 stream to the FPV\_VR app. RAW is also possible. Most important is that all settings in the app match those on your GroundPi.
