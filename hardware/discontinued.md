As OpenHD continues to evolve and introduce new features that require enhanced performance, we have made the decision to discontinue support for certain hardware that was previously compatible with earlier versions.

The following Single Board Computer (SBC) models are no longer supported:

| SBC                   |

| Raspberry Pi 1        |
| Raspberry Pi CM1      |
| Raspberry Pi Zero     |
| Raspberry Pi Zero W   |
| Jetson Nano 2GB       |
| Jetson Nano 4GB       |
