# Cameras

As part of the larger OpenHD ecosystem, the OpenHD custom hardware project aims to develop a specialized camera designed to work seamlessly with the OpenHD Custom Hardware project.

The custom cameras will be optimized for use in drone racing and aerial videography applications, offering high-quality imaging capabilities and low latency transmission. They will be designed to integrate seamlessly with the OpenHD Custom Hardware system, providing a complete end-to-end solution for drone enthusiasts.

The OpenHD custom hardware project is currently in development, and prototypes are being tested and refined to ensure optimal performance and reliability. As the project progresses, the team will be working to create a final version of the cameras that meets the needs of drone racing and aerial videography enthusiasts.
