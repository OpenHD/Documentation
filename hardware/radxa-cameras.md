# Cameras

### Overview

Since the Rock5 is a complete different platform and MIPI is not a plug and play system, we need to wait for official Cameras.

We're already investing resources to bring more cameras in the future.

Currently the Support is limited to 

| Camera                                |  Recommended  |  Notes  |
| ------------------------------------- | :-----------: | :-----: |
| IMX219                                |               |  1      |
| IMX415*                               |       *       |         |
