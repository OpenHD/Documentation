The Jetson Nano is a capable H265 encoding device, that's why we started to support it in our 
2.2-evo releases.
Since it is fundamently different and doesn't give any advantage on the Ground, we do not officially support it as GroundSBC.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since Nvidia refused to update the Jetson SBC's at all and their software is totally outdated. We decided to discontinue Jetson Support in the upcoming releases.
