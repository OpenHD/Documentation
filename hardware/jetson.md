The Jetson Nano is a capable H265 encoding device, that's why we supported it in our 
2.2-evo till 2.3-evo releases. 
Since it is fundamently different and doesn't give any advantage on the Ground, we do not officially support it as GroundSBC.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since Nvidia refused to update the Jetson SBC's at all and their software is totally outdated. We decided to discontinue Jetson Support. However experienced Developers can build and maintain their own Jetson images.
{% endhint %}
