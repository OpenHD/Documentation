# X86

X86 is a quite common Architecture. Most of modern Computers do run X86 processors, which often are much more powerfull then any SBC.

With 2.2-evo we start to support X86 in two ways.

1. We provide Images which are already setup and can be used via plugging an external USB-Drive/USB-Stick into your computer and run it live. (these images are currently in a very early stage, please report bugs and porblems)
2. We provide X86 packages for Ubuntu 20.04. If you want you can build your own OpenHD Image/Setup right on your computer.

X86 will have different performance gains or losses depending on the Hardware used.
The OpenHD Developers use quite potent Gaming-Hardware to test, so your experience will vary.

OpenHD will also interfere with your normal wifi-setup, it requires special drivers and may cause problems on your own installs.Thats why support always will be limited.

## Starting OpenHD on X86

We added OpenHD as Standart Linux Application, so you can find it under Applications.
Please select OpenHD-Air or OpenHD-Ground depending on your usecase.
When running OpenHD as Air, you also need to start QOpenHD.
