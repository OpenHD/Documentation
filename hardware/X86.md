# X86

X86 is a quite common Architecture. Most of modern Computers do run X86 processors, which often are much more powerfull then any SBC.

With 2.2-evo we start to support X86 in two ways.

1. We will provide Images which are already setup and can be used via Plugging an external USB-Drive/USB-Stick into your computer and run it live.
2. We provide X86 packages for Ubuntu 20.04. If you want you can build your own OpenHD Image/Setup right on your computer.

X86 will have different performance gains or losses depending on the Hardware used.
The OpenHD Developers use quite potent Gaming-Hardware to test, so your experience will vary.

OpenHD will also interfere with your normal wifi-setup, it requires special drivers and may cause problems on your own installs.Thats why support always will be limited.

If your device has an webcam build in or plugged in, OpenHD will detect it and use it as an Air-SBC.
When using such devices we recommend not autostarting OpenHD and forcing it to be the ground with --force-ground. This also requires to launch QOpenHD manually
