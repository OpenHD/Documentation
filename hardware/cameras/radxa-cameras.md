# Cameras

## Overview

As the Rock5 is a distinct platform and MIPI is not a plug-and-play system, we are awaiting official camera releases for compatibility. We are actively dedicating resources to introduce more camera options in the future.

Currently, the camera support is limited to:

| Camera                   | Recommended | Notes |
| ------------------------ | :---------: | :---: |
| IMX219                   |             |   1   |
| IMX415*                  |      *      |       |
| Arducam IMX462 B0333     |      *      |   1   |
| Arducam IMX708 B0310     |      *      |   1   |


> **Note 1**: There currently appears to be no compatible adapter or camera with this sensor available for the Rock5.

We are working towards expanding the selection of supported cameras and adapters, and we appreciate your patience as we continue to develop and improve camera compatibility
