IP-Cameras are not specifically designed for low latency, and many of them have latency upwards of 500ms+, but there are specific cameras available for purchase that have reasonable latency closer to 100-200ms. Remember this latency will be added to the "normal" latency your system has. So most IP-Camera Setups will have 300-600ms latency. It is not recommended to use an IP-Camera as primary camera.
That means the main reason to choose an IP-Camera is to enable some custom features normal Cameras do not support.
