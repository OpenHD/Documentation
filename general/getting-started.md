# Getting Started

When a project reaches a certain stage, the amount of options to choose from can get pretty overwhelming. This section of the documentation is intended to help guide newcomers to the project towards their first functional Open.HD implementation. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have a pre-existing hardware requirement that is not met in this guide, it is still a good idea to follow the guide and make sure you have this, the simplest setup, working before venturing into the more complex setups. Every setup, no matter how complex uses the elements in this guide at it's base.

## Sourcing hardware

Assuming you are starting with nothing, we recommend you get the following hardware:

* A Raspberry Pi4B for the Ground SBC
* A Raspberry Pi3A+ or Raspberry Pi Zero for the Air SBC
* Two WiFi cards that support the band you want to use. \(See [WiFi Adapters](../hardware/wifi-adapters.md)\)
* An HDMI cable for connecting the Ground SBC to a screen
* An HDMI capable screen \(use your TV for testing!\)
* A mobile device capable of running QOpenHD and connecting to the Ground SBC
* Two BEC's for powering the Air and Ground SBC's. \(See Wiring -&gt; Power\)
* Various lengths of connection wires.
* A soldering iron and required disposables.

## Step-by-step

Now that you have your prerequisite hard- and software, we can get down to business.
