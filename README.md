# Introduction

Welcome to the Open.HD Introduction Page!

OpenHD uses off-the-shelf Wi-Fi adapters available for purchase online, however it is not standard Wi-Fi, which is unsuitable for low-latency or very long distance transmission. Instead, Open.HD configures the Wi-Fi adapter in a way that is closer to a simple broadcast, much like analog video transmission hardware you may be using already.

High definition video, 2-way UAV telemetry, audio, and RC control signals can all be sent over a single transmission channel.

A multi-platform [Open.HD app ](https://github.com/OpenHD/QOpenHD/releases)is available for live video with a customizable OSD.
