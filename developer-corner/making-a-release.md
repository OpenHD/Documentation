In order to push to the cloudsmith package group that is NOT for testing you have to create a tag in github from a terminal. It cannot be a lightweight tag. Correct format is:\
`git tag -a 2.0.9 -m "2.0.9"`\
\
Other useful commands in terminal in git playing with tags:

* See if there is a match\
  `git describe --exact-match HEAD`
* Push your new tag (will also trigger the build in drone.io since its a commit)\
  `git push --tags`
* Delete a tag\
  `git tag -d 2.0.9`

This way the package.sh script will see the tag in the git describe command and thus trigger a push to the appropriate directory.\
\
To pull the correct version of openhd you must define the version in the image builder stage 2\
`OPENHD_PACKAGES="openhd=2.0.9"`
