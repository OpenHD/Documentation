# Update packages on a Pi

This probably will only be done on a Ground-Pi as its usually much harder to give a data connection to an Air-Pi and then login.

ssh into the pi and give it internet connectiviy. Then issue the following commands in this example to update qopenhd app:

`sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install qopenhd`
