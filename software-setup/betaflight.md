# Betaflight

## General Information

Betaflight support is currently in development.

> **Warning:** Betaflight support is currently not enabled, and the development team is actively working on enabling it. It's important to be aware that Betaflight doesn't allow for bidirectional MavLink, meaning that settings cannot be changed via MavLink, and OpenHD-RC functionality is not available.
