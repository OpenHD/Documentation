While it is possible to connect a Phone or Tablet wirelessly through the WiFi Hotspot functionality, using a USB tethering solution is actually recommended. Disabling the WiFi Hotspot will reduce any interference in the reception of the signals from the Air SBC.

* Connect your Android smartphone or tablet via USB to the Ground SBC.
* Enable USB-Tethering in the options of your smartphone \(note, some smartphones don't support this out-of-the box or seem to have this function disabled, you may need a 3rd party app to make USB-Tethering work with your device\)

You can now connect using the [QOpen.HD](../ground-station-software/qopen.hd-recommended.md) app or any other ground control software.
